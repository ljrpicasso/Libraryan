#Welcome to the Libraryan

(* Yes, I know it is misspelled *)

This is a Library Management System (lms) written for school libraries, especially in the younger grades through high school. I will create better docs as I go, but the current list of to-dos include:

- ISBN Lookup
   1. Initial lookup from ISBNdb.org. This will allow automatic/quick entry of pertinent information without typing.
   2. Second lookup from ARBooklist.com - looks up the reading and interest level of the book, for use by school libraries, especially in the younger grades.
- Search books in the library, with filters. A major type of search will be based on the AR (advanced reading) interest level (age where the content of the book is aimed), reading level (how hard the words are to read), and points (how much work is involved in getting through the book for an appropriate child).
- Receive books into library
- Receive donated books. May include printing a donation receipt.
- Check-in/Check-out. For libraries using the card-in-the-back-of-the-book-method, all the check-outs will be to the teacher. Individual cards will be kept to maintain the details.
- Tracking of late fees (if configured)
- Reports
   1. Books Owned (with or without filters)
   2. Books Out
   3. Books Overdue
   4. Amounts overdue with patron information
   5. Books on order
   6. Quotes by Author
   7. Discard List (books ready to be tossed out)
